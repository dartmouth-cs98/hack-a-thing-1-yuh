For this Hack-A-Thing I worked by myself. I've always been interested in gaming so I set out to learn more about the inner mechanics of how a game works. Thus, I decided to follow a Unity tutorial to make a roll a ball game. The game works by rolling a ball and collecting pick ups. Once you collect all the pick ups you win the game.

In this game I learned how to first make a terrain and then a bunch of objects that can interact via physics. Additionally, creating many objects can be redundant so it was useful to learn how to create one object and apply all the attributes to the duplicates. Overall seeing the code behind the game and then deploying the game, made me recall playing with emulators and the similar setup.

The game overall was very bare bones and I aim to build a better game in the future, this could perhaps include aspects such as multiplayer. This was a very exciting experience, and in the future I want to improve the physics engine behind the game as it was difficult to navigate often.
